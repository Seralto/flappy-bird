# Flappy Bird (HTML5 + JS)

A faithful Flappy Bird clone built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, using open assets for sprites and sounds.

## How to Play
- Press <kbd>Space</kbd> or click/tap to make the bird flap and avoid the pipes.
- Try to fly as far as possible without hitting pipes or the ground. The game tracks your current score.

## Run the Game
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser. No installation is required.
2. Make sure the `sprites/` and `audio/` folders are in the same directory as `index.html`.

## Educational Purpose
This project demonstrates:
- Game loops and animation with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Sprite rendering and collision detection
- User input handling (keyboard, mouse, touch)
- Asset loading (images and audio)

The code is heavily commented for learning and teaching purposes.

## Assets & Credits
